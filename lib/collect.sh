# Single jq pass parsing every field; the order must match the reads below one-for-one.
# Newlines/carriage-returns inside values are first escaped to literal \n \r so each value stays on one line and fields don't misalign;
# all other control characters are stripped: C0 (incl. ESC, tab), DEL, AND the C1 block U+0080-U+009F (8-bit CSI/OSC/DCS — U+009B = "ESC [" on a UTF-8 terminal honoring C1, same injection class as a raw ESC; select keeps only `. >= 32 and (. < 127 or . > 159)`) — JSON's \u001b escape is legal input, and a raw ESC leaking out
# gets parsed by the terminal as CSI (injection risk), plus vis_width's width accounting wouldn't match the terminal and would push the single line into a wrap
# (reproduced in review: a session name containing ESC[1Zm renders as 121 cols at COLUMNS=120 → wraps).
# This is the only entry point for external strings, so after stripping, downstream can assume the string holds only our own SGR codes.
# Stripping uses explode/implode for codepoint filtering, not regex — jq's Oniguruma doesn't honor regex-layer backslash-u escapes,
# and a control-character range is treated as a literal character class (where the 0-u range strips almost all ASCII — already hit).
# jq inside the process substitution inherits the script's stdin (the statusline JSON).
# The last field (now|floor) also grabs the current Unix seconds for ttl, saving a date +%s fork.
# Each value is also capped to 256 codepoints (| .[0:256]): vis_width's ASCII-strip in render.sh is O(n^2) under bash 3.2, so an
# unbounded multi-KB field (e.g. a crafted session_name) would stall every frame (10KB → ~5s); 256 is far above any terminal's visible width, so render's "…" truncation still governs what shows.
